1. Var has a function scope , it adds itself to the window object, it can be redeclared.
   let has {} scope , it is the part of ES6 version of JS , it can be reassigned only.

2. Browser Context Api is a collection of window object, stack and heap memory present in Browser
  2.1 window object - It contains many features and properties provided by browser like console.log, alert etc.
  2.2 Stack - It is a type of Data structure which is used to store variables and points to their value which is stored in heap memory.
  2.3 Heap Memory - It is a memory which is used to store data .

3 . Execution Context - It is a container that is created whenever a function is called in the memory which contains
    3.1 - Varibales - It is the list of variables present in the function
    3.2 - Function - it contains all the functions that are declared inside the called function
    3.3 - Lexical environment - it is a chart which conatins the details of accessable variables and functions by the calling function

5. Spread Operator - It is used to copy reference variable. [...]
   Arrays, objects, String
   eg- const arr = [1,2,3]
       const brr -[...arr]

6. Falsy - values are false, null, NaN, undefined, document.all
   Truly - Which are not Falsy

7.ForEach - it is a function which is used in arrays to iterate over each element
         eg- array.ForEach(function(val){
            return val; 
         })     

  For in - It is a loop statement used by objects and arrays to iterate 
         eg- for(key in obj){
            return obj[key]
         }
